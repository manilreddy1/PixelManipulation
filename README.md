# Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic image encryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by swapping pixel values and applying mathematical transformations.

## Features
- Encrypt images using pixel manipulation.
- Decrypt encrypted images back to the original.
- Simple and secure image processing.

## How It Works
1. Pixels are swapped and manipulated based on a predefined key.
2. Users can provide a password that affects the encryption pattern.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manilreddy1/image-encryption-tool.git
